# LearningRust

A few examples of Rust code. For my own learning.

# Development

For ease of development use ```development.sh```. This script starts a Docker container that comes with Rust, Cargo, and Emacs fully configured for Rust development. It is based on a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/julitopower/rustemacs/) I created. Checkout my [docker-rust git repository](https://github.com/julitopower/docker-rust).

The project is mounted under ```/opt/src/``` in the container.
